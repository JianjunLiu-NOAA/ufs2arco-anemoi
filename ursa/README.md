This configuration is set up to run on Ursa.

Before getting started, you will need to set up a conda environment. First, if you have not already, use these instructions to set up miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#linux. Be sure to install this in your scratch directory, as the environment we will create is quite big.
